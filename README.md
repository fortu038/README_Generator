# README_generator

## Description

This project was done in order to practice using libraries, Javascript file importing and exporting, and using Javascript files through the terminal. The created program creates a README file based on user inputs. During this project I learned how to import and export multiple functions between Javascritp files and how to run Javascript through the terminal. I also got to practice using the JavaScript libraries inquirer and fs.

## Installation

The module inquirer version 8.2.4 must be installed using npm and the runtime Node.js must be installed

## Usage

This program can be used to create a README file based on user entries. The outline used for README structure can be found [here](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/github/professional-readme-guide). A notable feature of the created site is that the user can choose to not include a license or to state the the license is already in their Github repo.
